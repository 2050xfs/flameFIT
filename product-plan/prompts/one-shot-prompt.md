You are an expert full-stack developer. I have a complete product specification and design package for a fitness application called "flameFit".

Your task is to implement the backend, state management, and data integration for this application. I will provide you with the high-fidelity React components, TypeScript types, and detailed implementation instructions.

**Please start by reading the following files:**

1. `product-plan/product-overview.md` - To understand the product vision.
2. `product-plan/instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` - To understand the implementation plan and TDD requirements.
3. `product-plan/data-model/README.md` - To understand the data architecture.

Wait for me to upload these files, then acknowledge receipt and we will proceed with Milestone 1.
