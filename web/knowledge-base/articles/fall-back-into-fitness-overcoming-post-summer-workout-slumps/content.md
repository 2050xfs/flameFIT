Summer can throw a lot of people’s routines off as school is out, and parents try to keep their kids busy, vacations are enjoyed, or the laid-back vibe loosens fitness routines. As fall approaches, it’s time to start thinking about how to adjust your routine to keep your fitness on track or reset. Here are some tips for those looking to stay on track or get back on track this fall.

### **Are You a Step-at-a-Time or All-In Person?**

If you’re ready to take action on your fitness routine this fall, you should honestly ask yourself if you’re the type of person who should take one small step at a time or needs to start with a significant change. What you consider a small versus big step is up to you and differs from person to person. Knowing what kind of start you need is essential because starting the right way for you will build momentum and progress that can be sustained.

For example, perhaps you’ve gotten off track this summer and need to take a small step forward. If you need to start with a small step to return to your routine, the more significant steps may be too ambitious and overwhelming. Remember, you’re the most vulnerable to backtracking when you just start a routine, so you want to start with something you will likely succeed in. Here are some first steps that may be too big:

* Purchasing a large piece of gym equipment like a treadmill
* Trying to start back in the gym seven days a week
* Jumping into a high-intensity workout class
* Signing up for a demanding event soon

If you’ve identified that you need a small step-at-a-time approach to your fitness routine, align your first steps with a goal that you consider bite-sized and attainable. Accomplishing bite-sized goals can offer a confidence boost and positive association with exercise for those new to exercise or those who have been off track for a while and need to reorientate themselves in the right direction.

On the other hand, if small steps don’t motivate you enough to sustain a new routine, you may get bored, experience lackluster progress, or abandon it altogether. Here are some small steps that may not deliver as much drive to get you started strong (remember, this differs from person to person).

* An easy at-home workout with limited equipment
* An overly-familiar routine
* A low-intensity activity
* Going back to the same gym or class

If you’ve identified yourself as someone who needs a big change to get you going, don’t undershoot your first goals! Setting a big, exciting goal can give you the motivation and thrill of getting back on track.

### **All About Motivating Yourself**

Whether you need a big or small start to return to your routine this fall, pick an appropriate first step that will be engaging to help you maintain motivation and see progress. Finding a balance between challenging yourself and keeping workouts interesting and varied is essential. Gradually increasing the intensity and complexity of your fitness routine can help keep you engaged and motivated.
