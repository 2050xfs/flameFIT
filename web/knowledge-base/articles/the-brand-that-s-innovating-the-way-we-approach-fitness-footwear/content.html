<h6 dir="ltr"><em>“That Fit Friend” is rewriting the way consumers try on and purchase athletic shoes. </em></h6>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There’s a new way to find the perfect fit when it comes to training footwear, and Jake Boly’s </span><a href="https://thatfitfriend.com/"><span>That Fit Friend</span></a><span> </span><span>is leading the charge. </span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Five years ago Jake set out on a journey of his own. He spent the seven years prior flexing his B.S. in exercise science and M.S. in sports science, nabbed editorial gigs with Vitamin Shoppe and Barbend, and became a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS). When 2020 hit, and life as we knew it ceased to exist, Jake decided it was time for a personal change. </span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“<em>I wanted to build long form articles and videos that had my view, my take and my recommendations for those searching for the right shoe</em>,” said Boly. “<em>I know the industry, I know what people are looking for and I put that content together on a consistent basis which lead to growth over time</em>.”</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>That Fit Friend </span><span>is now inching towards 50k subscribers on </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/jakebolytraining"><span>YouTube</span></a><span>, where Jake himself can be found reviewing the latest releases and innovations in the fitness footwear space. From strength and barefoot to performance and hybrid, no corner of the gym shoe world is left untouched. He’s hand-tested over 400 pairs of sneakers, bringing them into the mix for his own workouts to ensure an honest and accurate assessment. Now, with reps under his belt and a firm understanding of what does, and does not resonate with consumers seeking advice for their next buy, Jake is turning his digital footprint into a real life experience. </span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He recently debuted the first </span><a href="https://shop.thatfitfriend.com/"><span>That Fit Friend</span><span> retail shop</span></a><span> in Chesterfield, Missouri. It comes as a partnership with premier performance gym, </span><a href="https://www.coalitionstl.com/"><span>Coalition</span></a><span> and aims to provide the local community with a personalized solution to finding the perfect fit. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“<em>I wanted to build a shoe store where you can come in and physically try and train in the shoes, within an actual gym</em>,” said Boly. “<em>We’re combining the education that’s led </em></span><em>That Fit Friend </em><span><em>for the last five years and bringing in community.</em>” </span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The partnership with Coalition allows for seamless cross promotion, giving gym members access to a one-of-a-kind shoe fitting and customers visiting </span><span>That Fit Friend</span><span> the opportunity to find a state of the art training facility to call home. Boly’s also trained a number of Coalition coaches on the fitting process, allowing them to collect a commission. This not only allows trainers to link with potential clients, but brings peace of mind to Boly knowing trained fitness professionals are working directly with his customers. </span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The process typically begins with a scan to assess arch height, instep, width, etc. all to provide a foundation for Boly and team’s recommendation. They talk with a customer to better understand their fitness goals, the type of movement they participate in, and any past or current injuries at play. From there, options are laid out and the customer is prompted to take them for a test drive on the training floor of the gym. </span><span>The department stores could never</span><span>. If a customer gives the thumbs up, Boly can send them home with a purchased pair or place an online order if they’re seeking additional color ways. What happens to the tested shoes you asked? Alas, no shoe goes wasted. Boly is offering them up for a discounted resell price in the “garage sale” section of his site to help those who may not be able to afford fully priced shoes nab them at a discount.</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The mission and mantra is strong with </span><span>That Fit Friend</span><span>, striving to fill the education gap for both athletes and trainers alike, all while creating connections in the community. The recent unveiling and opening of the first storefront was close to home — literally — as Chesterfield is Boly’s hometown. Some days you can find Boly’s mother helping ship out orders, </span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Boly and the team at </span><span>That Fit Friend</span><span> have a bright future ahead. They plan to explore additional partnerships with gyms in the U.S. to stand up storefronts and testing centers, and expand on the goal of helping people access customized shoe fittings for movement. Boly himself is using his gained knowledge and compiled data to debut a private label shoe, set to launch in 2026.</span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“<em>Connecting people with the right shoe for their preferred movement and doing it through the foundation of community is all I want to do. We’re full steam ahead without losing the reason why we started</em>.”</span></p>
