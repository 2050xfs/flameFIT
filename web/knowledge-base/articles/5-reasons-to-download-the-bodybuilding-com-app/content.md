**BBCOM Editors**

Over the years, Bodybuilding.com has debuted several app experiences, most notably BodySpace and BodyFit, where users could workout, track progress, and more. There comes a time, though, where streamlining and efficiency become the top priority for a brand and its users—and that time is now.

Welcome to the new [Bodybuilding.com app](https://shop.bodybuilding.com/pages/bbcom-membership?utm_source=bbcom&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=app_launch&utm_id=app).

Designed with seven different ways to workout, trackable health metrics, a customized social experience and an in-app shopping hub for your supplements needs, the BBCOM app is the key to unlocking your true potential. Though don’t just take our word for it. Dive into why you should download the Bodybuilding.com app now.  

### 1. Choose Your Workout Experience

Follow along with guided workouts led by our [coaches](https://shop.bodybuilding.com/pages/our-coaches), choose an accessory, dive into a multi-week program, design your own workout/program, stack your experiences, or learn new moves with our movement library. There’s a way to work out for everyone.

Our team of Master Coaches consists of accredited professionals with decades of experience. They’ll lead multiple modalities ranging from strength and hypertrophy to body recomp and performance. Need a timeout? Pause a workout at any time to watch the movement tutorial without exiting. Time for a rest day? Jump into an accessory to take a breathwork, stretching, or mobility sequence.

Take planning into your own hands by constructing a workout or program specific to you. Build out your calendar using the move library or stack pre-existing workouts together. Find your routine with endless possibilities.

### 2. Connect With Likeminded Users

Chasing goals requires support, and when it comes to finding support, community is king. Build your profile, share content, and scroll the feed to find your favorite lifters, workouts, and accounts.

Don’t want to share with the world? No sweat. Set your profile to private and accept invites when they come. You’ll be able to like, comment, share, and save content in your feed. Stay tuned for our “Groups” feature coming in 2025, where locals can plan meetups IRL—because nothing beats training together.

### 3. Track Metrics and Store Data

Stored in your profile, connect your Apple Watch or allow access to Health Kit to stay on top of heart rate, calories, and other key metrics. Trying to break down your splits? “Blue Man” (our enduring anatomy graphic) is here to help track which muscle groups you’ve worked this week to help inform your next workout selection.

We’ll be revealing new devices eligible for syncing in 2025.

### 4. Earn Badges and Rewards

It’s true, we’re all still utterly obsessed with collecting badges, and you can collect a set of your very own in the app. From “total weight lifted” milestones to streak celebrations to limited-edition holiday badges, there’s a new goal to chase every month. Don’t worry, we reward recovery warriors, too.

Be on the lookout for future badge releases. Have a concept? [Hit up our team](https://support.bodybuilding.com/en-US/contact) to bring your badge to life.

### 5. Shop Supplements

Yes, you’ll be able to shop for your favorite supplements directly in the app. Did we mention it’s as easy as one click? Annual members will be eligible for year-round free shipping on orders, 10% off our Signature™ line (+ ALL its new products 👀), and if you join now, you’ll earn a $49.99 product coupon to kickstart your journey. The ease of merging supps with your workout plan is here.

Later this year, we’ll be activating a feature that helps you track when it’s time to restock based on your workout routine.

BodyFit and BodySpace are hitting retirement, but their features have been transferred and improved in the new app. This applies to content, too! If you’re a former member of either app, your history has been transferred to the new app as of December 27, 2024. Head to your app store and update to unlock the [Bodybuilding.com app](https://shop.bodybuilding.com/pages/bbcom-membership?utm_source=bbcom&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=app_launch&utm_id=app). Same great features with an overdue upgrade 💪
