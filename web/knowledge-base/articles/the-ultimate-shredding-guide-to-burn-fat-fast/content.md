If you’re not exactly where you want to be before hitting the beach, fear not, for we’ve got a checklist to hit hard. Think of it as your “in case of emergency, break glass”, list. Let’s dive in.

There’s no room here for a crash or fad “diet”. Though there are some controllables to reign in starting today. In three weeks, we can typically cut 3-6 pounds, reduce bloating, increase energy, and clear up skin, just by making the following a priority.

## No Nonsense Nutrition

It’s no shock that our mission starts in the kitchen. Reminder: You can’t outwork a bad diet. No number of crunches or cardio will supersede excess consumption, especially that of ultra-processed foods, alcohol and sugars.

**1. Eat In a Caloric D****eficit.** I’m not in measuring mode year-round. In fact, I rarely measure nowadays after years of educating myself on the general calories associated with the food I’m fueling with. When push comes to shove, and you’re on a tight deadline, measuring will be your best friend. We’ll need to measure not only the calories in, but the calories out. This will include understanding your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) and TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure). Understanding both individualized numbers will confirm that you hit a daily calorie deficit. Your basal metabolic rate is produced through the following formula:

Men: BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x weight in kg) + (4.799 x height in cm) – (5.677 x age in years)

Women: BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 x weight in kg) + (3.098 x height in cm) – (4.330 x age in years)

Once that’s done, we can add it to the total calories burned that day to find your TDEE. Eating 500-700 calories below your TDEE per day is the sweet spot for steady, healthy weight loss (about 1-1.5 pounds a week).

**2. Prioritize Whole, Unprocessed Foods:** Now’s the time to put down the prepackaged goods and aim for whole foods. Really, this should be a goal throughout the year. We’ve become too complacent on foods full of gums and fillers that are disrupting our body’s gut microbiome. I digress. When you’re looking to shred, aim for loads of veggies, lean proteins (chicken, fish, tofu, eggs), fruits, and healthy fats. Carefully count your healthy fat calories as things like avocados, nuts, and olive oil tend to pack more calories than we often assume. This is a great time to cut refined carbs, desserts, fried foods, and yes, alcohol. More on that in a moment.

**3. Ditch the Booze**: I’m not suggesting a breakup, (though it wouldn’t be the biggest loss of your life), but in crunch mode, cutting alcohol can make a big difference. We fail to realize just how many calories and sugar are packed in our favorite drinks. Start the day with a glass of lemon water to help with bloating. Lemon also helps stimulate the production of bile in the body and kickstarts digestion, “waking” your gut up first thing in the morning. Aim for an additional 8-10 glasses of water throughout the day to aid in appetite control and metabolism support.

## Movement Matters

We good on nutrition? Cool. Now, for movement. Here’s where you can not only burn another ~500 calories each day but build the areas you’re looking to strengthen for both function and aesthetics.

1. **Cardio: Every. Damn.** **Day.** Yep, everyday folks. BEFORE YOU ROLL YOUR EYES- The intensity levels of these sessions are going to vary. We are NOT running sprints and maxing out our central nervous system every day of the week. We ARE taking advantage of the fat burning qualities of steady state cardio. Here’s my cardio split when I’m seeking to drop pounds fast:

*Sunday:* 1 hour of Stairs at Zone 2

*Monday:* 20-minute row+ 2–3-mile Zone 1 walk after dinner

*Tuesday:* 20-minutes Zone 2 Stairs, 20-min Zone 3 Jog, 20-min Zone 4-5 Sprints for a 60-minute workout

*Wednesday:* 15-min Zone 4 Metcon

*Thursday:* 45-min Zone 2 Bike

*Friday:* 40-minute Zone 2-3 Jog

*Saturday:* Active Recovery= 3-mile Zone 1-2 Weighted Vest Walk

The goal is to work in all zones for heart health while prioritizing fat burning zones living in 60-70% of your max heart rate.

2. **Strength Train: 3x/Week:** I’m the first to admit that lifting is way more fun than cardio, and it’s crucial for not only muscle building but fat burning. Strength training also has an incredible impact on metabolism and a higher muscle mass index is associated with a higher BMR. A higher BMR equates to more calories being burned at rest- before you even hit the gym for the day. The more calories you’re burning in a resting state, the less you have to rely on exhausting yourself at the gym just to ensure you’re eating below the threshold from point one. It’s all connected, folks. Here’s my 3-day split in weight loss mode:

*Sunday:* Upper & Lower Split + Accessories (Machine + Cable Work)

*Monday:* Pull Day- Deadlifts, Rows, RDL’s, etc.

*Wednesday:* Push Day- Back Squat, OH Press, Push Ups, etc.
