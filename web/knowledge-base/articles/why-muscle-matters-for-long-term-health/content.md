# Why Muscle Matters for Long-Term Health

When most people think about muscle, they picture aesthetics; toned arms, sculpted shoulders, six-pack abs. But the truth is, muscle is one of your body’s most vital health assets. It's not just about how you look; it's about how well your body functions.

We’re breaking down why building and maintaining muscle is key to your overall health, performance, and longevity.

**1. Muscle is Metabolically Active**

Muscle isn’t just passive tissue, it’s a glucose-regulating powerhouse. The leaner muscle you have, the better your body can manage blood sugar levels and insulin response. Muscle helps lower the risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. It also plays a major role in reducing inflammation and improving body composition. Unlike fat, muscle burns calories at rest, meaning it boosts your resting metabolic rate, the amount of energy (calories) your body uses to maintain basic bodily functions and perform physical activity.

**2. Muscle Strengthens the Brain, Too**

The benefits of muscle go beyond the physical. Resistance training increases levels of BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), a compound that supports memory, learning, and mood regulation. Muscle strength is linked to better cognitive performance, especially as we age, and studies show that consistent resistance training reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety. Strong body, strong mind.

**3. Protects Joints, Bones & Balance**

As we age, we naturally lose muscle mass. It’s a process called sarcopenia, which begins as early as your 30’s. Without resistance training, it accelerates, leading to loss of mobility, balance, and independence. Muscle protects your joints and bones, making everyday movement safer and more efficient. It reduces the risk of falls, fractures, and other mobility-related injuries. Strength training can also improve bone density, lowering the risk of osteoporosis.

**4. More Muscle, Less Risk**

Think of muscle as long-term health insurance. Research shows that higher muscle mass is associated with:

* Lower all-cause mortality

* Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic illness\*

* Improved outcomes in recovery from surgery, illness, and injury

While building muscle supports heart and metabolic health, it’s also important to look beyond traditional markers like total cholesterol or BMI. Consider asking your healthcare provider for tests like apolipoprotein B (apoB) and lipoprotein(a), which provide a more accurate picture of cardiovascular risk than a standard lipid panel alone. If you have a family history of heart disease, you may need to work harder to offset a genetic predisposition. That’s not discouragement, that’s empowerment

Muscle is more than what we see in the mirror. It’s functional strength, metabolic stability, and protective power for every system in your body. Keep lifting, keep fueling, and keep honoring your body.
