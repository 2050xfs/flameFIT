# 4 Signs Overtraining is Stalling Your Progress

**Date:** July 10, 2025

Today we’re talking about overtraining. Simplified, it means you’re doing too much and it may be time to chill the f\*ck out. But hey, it happens to the best of us. For me, movement is what I look forward to the most every day. Whether it’s hitting the gym, going for a run or getting in a yoga flow, I plan every day around my movement of choice, which ultimately keeps me disciplined and focused in other aspects of my life.

When it’s time to take things up a notch, I find myself in overdrive. I become hyper fixated on fitting in every single modality from running, cycling, swimming, lifting, stretching and physio sessions that I find the most important piece last on the list-recovery. Event or no event, anyone can overtrain, and most of the time? They don’t even know they’re doing it. They analyze every other possibility because the thought of working out too much is unfathomable. 

Overtraining doesn’t just overwhelm the muscular system. It can decrease the immune system’s ability to fight infections and bacteria, disrupt neuromuscular excitability (often brought on from poor sleep), impact the adrenal response and even slow growth hormone release. While there’s no test that can tell us in black and white that you’re overtraining, there are telltale signs to lookout for if you’ve been hitting it hard for more than a few weeks.  

Here are four ways to tell if you’re overtraining:

## Stubborn Soreness

It’s normal to be sore after a tough or heavy workout. It’s not-so-normal for the soreness to last 5 days or more. Ensure you’re rotating between focal points of the body and avoid training the same muscle two days in a row. If you went through the ringer yesterday, it might be time for a rest day today. Your body will tell you when you wake up. Drop the ego, and recognize when it’s time to dial things back. If you’re training for an event, that’s not always possible. Heard. Get strategic with how much time you’re spending on your feet when you aren’t training. Small adjustments can make a big impact.

## Exhaustion & Impacted Mood

Whether overtraining is affecting your sleep cycle or your body is using most of its energy to repair your muscles, fatigue can be disruptive to your entire routine. Next thing you know you’re lashing out at people about things that wouldn’t normally bother you. Remember what I said above, training doesn’t just take a toll on muscle. Your central nervous system needs rest and recovery just as much as the rest of your body does. Sleep is the greatest gift you can give your brain and will help you to respond better to stressful situations rather than reacting. Avoid digging a sleep deficit, especially with a heavier training load. 

## Recurring Injuries

Muscle strains, stress fractures, and inflammatory tissue responses are just a few signs that you’re pushing yourself a bit too hard. If you’re nursing an injury with an event fast approaching, it may be time to deload or taper, even if it’s a bit earlier than expected. Injuries suck, I get it, and I’ve been there, plenty.  Better to find a modification or spend time working on other weaknesses rather than pushing through. Taking time off is the last thing any of us want to do, but better for it to last a few days to a week rather than a few months to a year. Listen to your body; it’s equipped with dashboard warning lights. When the check engine light comes on, don’t ignore it. 

## Declining Performance

You can’t finish sets at the weight you used last week. You’re so winded that you’ve cut the cardio session short. The numbers today don’t match the numbers from yesterday. Overtraining can lead to lower performance. It may be time to reevaluate your current program and ask yourself if it’s attainable for the next several weeks. 

Listen to your body before it forces you to take a full stop period of rest. It's always talking to you.
