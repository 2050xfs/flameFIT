Cardio remains a cornerstone of fitness for getting in shape and maximizing your summer shred. Cardio exercise is for you whether you want to burn fat, boost endurance, or elevate your overall health. As the temperature rises and the days grow longer, now is the perfect time to explore new and exciting forms of cardio to supercharge your workouts.

From high-intensity sweat sessions that push your limits to low-intensity routines that keep you moving steadily, let's introduce you to the best high and low-intensity forms of cardio to try this summer.

### **High-Intensity - Cardio Outdoor Workout**

[High-intensity interval training](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/6-hiit-workouts-you-have-to-try.html) is a training style with a specific work-to-rest ratio. Usually, the work-to-rest ratio is at least 1:2, sometimes up to 1:12. A 1:4 work-to-rest ratio could be a 10-second activity with 40 seconds of rest. The intensity ratio is near maximal, so much rest is needed.

Now that it is warming up, take your high-intensity cardio workout outdoors! The workout can be as short as 5 minutes and usually no longer than 20-30 minutes. Pick a work-to-rest ratio within the limits above and start with 6 training rounds.

### **High-Intensity - Pickleball or Spikeball**

Pickleball and spikeball are dynamic, high-intensity cardio exercises perfect for enjoying an active summer. These fast-paced sports combine the thrill of competition with a full-body workout, ensuring you burn calories while having a blast.

Pickleball requires quick reflexes, sharp lateral movements, and continuous engagement. It improves agility and cardiovascular endurance.

Spikeball is a beach-friendly game involving a small, round net and a bouncing ball. It demands rapid sprints, dives, and powerful strikes and offers an intense full-body activity.

Both sports are social and highly engaging, providing a workout and a fun and interactive way to stay fit with friends. Whether on the court or in the sand, pickleball and spikeball will keep your heart pumping and your fitness on track this summer.

### **Low-Intensity - Biking**

Biking is a fantastic low-intensity cardio exercise perfect for summer. It offers a fun and effective way to stay fit while enjoying the outdoors. Whether cruising along scenic bike paths, exploring urban routes, or taking leisurely rides through the countryside, biking provides a steady cardiovascular workout that’s gentle on the joints.

Additionally, biking engages significant muscle groups in the legs, glutes, and core, contributing to overall strength and stability. The freedom to explore new areas and the summer breeze make biking not just a workout but an enjoyable adventure that keeps you motivated and active all season long.

### **Low-Intensity - Hiking**

Hiking is an excellent low-intensity cardio exercise that's perfect for summer. It offers a blend of physical activity and the great outdoors, making it an ideal choice for those looking to stay active without the intensity of a gym workout. As you navigate trails and tackle gentle inclines, hiking elevates your heart rate just enough to improve cardiovascular health while being easy on your joints.

The varied terrain engages different muscle groups, promoting muscle tone and endurance. Plus, the scenic views and fresh air provide mental health benefits, turning your workout into a rejuvenating escape from the everyday grind. Whether exploring local trails or adventuring in national parks, hiking is a versatile and enjoyable way to maintain your fitness all summer.
