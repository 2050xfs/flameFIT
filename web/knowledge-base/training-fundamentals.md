# FlameFit Training Fundamentals

## Progressive Overload
Progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress placed upon the body during exercise training.

### Key Principles:
1. **Increase Weight**: Add 2.5-5% more weight when you can complete all sets with good form
2. **Increase Volume**: Add more sets or reps
3. **Increase Frequency**: Train muscle groups more often
4. **Decrease Rest**: Reduce rest periods between sets

## Recovery
Recovery is when your muscles repair and grow stronger.

### Recovery Guidelines:
- Sleep 7-9 hours per night
- Rest 48-72 hours between training same muscle groups
- Stay hydrated (3-4 liters water daily)
- Consume adequate protein (1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight)

## Nutrition for Muscle Growth
Proper nutrition fuels your workouts and recovery.

### Macro Breakdown:
- **Protein**: 30-35% of calories
- **Carbohydrates**: 40-50% of calories
- **Fats**: 20-30% of calories

### Pre-Workout Meal (2-3 hours before):
- Complex carbs (oats, rice, sweet potato)
- Lean protein (chicken, fish, tofu)
- Small amount of healthy fats

### Post-Workout Meal (within 2 hours):
- Fast-digesting protein (whey, chicken breast)
- Simple carbs (white rice, banana)
