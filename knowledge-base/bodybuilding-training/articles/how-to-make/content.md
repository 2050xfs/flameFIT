# How to Make the Most of Your Winter Arc

As the temperature drops it’s easy to let motivation cool off. Though alas, winter is where true transformation begins. Welcome to your winter arc, the time to build, recover, and refocus. Here’s how to make the most of it.

### Shift Into Growth Mode

Winter isn’t just “bulking season.” It’s your time to train with purpose. Focus on strength cycles that feature heavier lifts, lower reps and proper form. Increase calories mindfully if you’re fueling for gains. Think about high [protein](https://shop.bodybuilding.com/collections/protein) muscle fuel, not mindless munching. Track progress, via the notes app or your favorite smart device, as documenting your journey will help you understand what works, and what doesn’t. Small, consistent improvements now set up your summer physique.

### Eat Smart Through the Holidays

Enjoying the holiday season doesn’t have to result in running the train off the track. Follow these three steps to avoid sabotaging your progress:

1. Plan your indulgences:  Don’t skip breakfast before a big meal; eat protein early to stay satisfied. Add a scoop of [Signature™ Whey](https://shop.bodybuilding.com/products/bodybuilding-signature-whey-protein) to your morning oatmeal for a warm, protein-packed start.
2. Prioritize protein: From turkey to tofu, build every plate around the most maximizing macro.
3. Hydrate: Cold air dehydrates you faster and can’t retain as much water vapor as warm air. When you breathe in cold, your body must humidify and warm that air before it reaches your lungs. This process uses moisture from your respiratory tract, which you then lose as water vapor when you exhale. Aim for 100+ ounces of water a day.

### Recover Like a Pro

With more time indoors, recovery can become your secret weapon. Aim to sleep 7–9 hours for growth hormone and muscle repair. Practice daily mobility with dedicated stretches or foam rolling as a post-workout and rest day routine, and seal the deal with supplements: [Creatine](https://shop.bodybuilding.com/collections/creatine) + glutamine + a [multivitamin](https://shop.bodybuilding.com/products/kaged-multivitamin) = your winter recovery stack.

Bundle up, fuel up, and lift heavy. Your arc is unfolding.
