<p dir="ltr"><meta charset="utf-8"/>In theory, the squat seems like a rather simplistic movement pattern. You bend your knees and stand back up again, right? Those who are familiar with loaded back squats will beg to differ. Many athletes first learn this movement as part of a basic squat workout, which quickly shows how technical the exercise really is.<b id="docs-internal-guid-596357f8-7fff-d0b2-09a7-1c19c5545aed"><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The squat is one of the six fundamental movement patterns, technically seven if you're crediting isolated core exercises in addition to hip dominant movement, knee dominant movement, vertical press, vertical pull, horizontal press, and horizontal pull. Every squat program and strength program should include variations of these patterns to ensure all muscle groups are being worked appropriately for optimal strength gains. But today, we’re breaking down the squat, making it easier to understand how it fits into any squat workout or lower-body training day.</span><span><b id="docs-internal-guid-4f8ff298-7fff-1ce3-b670-85002707b58a"></b> </span><b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><meta charset="utf-8"/>When it comes to the squat, pick your poison; back squat, front squat, hack squat, goblet squat, and whatever other 100+ naming conventions exist today. The type of squat you choose to perform will likely be dependent on which muscles you’re aiming to target. Looking to beef up the quads while getting a tighter core? Load up your front squats and goblet squats—perfect choices in any squat program. Chasing stronger glutes, hamstrings, and back? Back squats for breakfast. </span></p>
<h2>Master Your Squat Workout: 3 Moves to Supercharge Your Squat Program</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Regardless of what goal you’re chasing, increase your overall range of motion and mobility within the squat movement pattern with these three tips: </span><b></b></p>

<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Loose Hips Sink Ships</span><span>: Part of keeping a strong squat form is prioritizing hip health. As someone who underwent three hip surgeries before the age of 23, take the tip of striving for superior hip mobility. Start and end your days on a carpet in the house or soft surface for a few rounds of hip 90/90, pigeon, child’s pose and whatever else feels good for you. We often wait to focus on the small stuff after an injury. Be proactive and keep your body primed. The smoother the hip glide, the smoother squat pattern. The top joints to focus on for better squats include hips, knees and ankles.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Weighted Stretching: </span><span>Hear me out here, this isn’t for your first day. Over time you’ll begin to understand which muscles need the most love. Sitting against a wall in a pancake position not only helps you stay honest with how mobile the hips and adductors are, but added something as light as five pounds to each knee can give those muscles a few centimeters of help. A forward fold off of a slightly elevated surface again with a lighter weight in hands can help stretch out the posterior chain. Key: Do these after your workouts or on a rest day. Long, static stretching isn’t ideal before lifts that require short lower output. </span></p>

Get your a** to grass and set the clock for 1:00. Increase your depth and time as it gets easier</span><span>. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>A lot of us are eager to lift heavier weight, but without the right form, you’re putting the cart before the horse. Focus on the small stuff before you conquer the big stuff. </span></p>
