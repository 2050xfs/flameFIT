# The Best Ab Workout For A Six Pack

---

How do you train to get six-pack abs? You can do it with long and complicated training, like many people do, but in my book, the best ab workout is the one you'll do over and over again.

Yes, it's true that that abs are earned in the kitchen—not the gym. But if six-pack abs are your goal, it's also important to pick the right ab workout for the job.

This workout is composed of seven ab exercises carefully chosen to work both the upper and lower ab muscles. Hit this workout hard three times a week, stick to a healthy diet that goes easy on the calories, do some lifting and the right amount of cardio, and you'll soon see some serious six-pack progress.

## The "Magnificent 7" Ab Circuit

**1. CIRCUIT**

Perform the exercises in order with no rest between exercises and 2 min. rest between rounds.

**Sit-up**

3 sets, 12-15 reps (no rest)

**Lying Leg Raise**

3 sets, 12-15 reps (no rest)

**V-up**

3 sets, 12-15 reps (no rest)

**Seated leg tuck**

3 sets, 12-15 reps (no rest)

**Toe Touch**

3 sets, 12-15 reps (no rest)

**Crunches**

3 sets, 12-15 reps (no rest)

**Reverse crunch**

3 sets, 12-15 reps (rest 2 min.)

### How to Do This Core Routine

This is a fairly advanced ab workout, so how you do it matters.

Beginners are better off performing just three out of the seven exercises for two sets each of as many reps as possible, with a minute of rest between sets. From there, build up your fitness and endurance by adding exercises and sets and cutting back on your rest periods.

A reasonable goal is to be able to do the seven exercises in a big circuit all at once, rest a minute or two, and repeat it two more times by the end of 12 weeks.

As you build up to that, feel free to break up the workout in different ways. For instance, I like to perform supersets like this:

**Repeat 3 times:**

* Exercise 1 and 2, rest 30 sec.
* Exercise 3 and 4, rest 30 sec.
* Exercise 5 and 6, rest 30 sec.
* Exercise 7, rest 60 sec.

Perform each set to momentary muscle failure, or until you can't easily do another rep.

Note that I haven't included any direct oblique work. In my experience, direct oblique work only leads to a wider waistline. Besides, obliques get enough stimulation from exercises like squats, deadlifts, and other full-body weight training.

### When to Work Your Abs

For most people, performing this routine a minimum of three days per week will be plenty. An advanced bodybuilder could do it just about every day.

Personally, I like to head to the gym early and do abs and cardio first thing in the morning, then come back in the afternoon for weight training. That way, I get to spike up my metabolism twice a day.

If you'd rather do the workout in one session, I recommend either performing the ab routine as a warm-up for your weight training or after your training if you're going to be doing heavy lifting like squats or deadlifts. Then perform your cardio last.

### How to Make This Ab Routine Easier or Harder

If you can't do an exercise, due to lower-back injuries for instance, feel free to substitute it with an exercise that doesn't bother your back.

If, on the other hand, you have a healthy lower back and would like to add extra mass to your abs, do the workout three times a week and use some resistance in the exercises, such as holding a small plate or dumbbell.
