Above all, an effective gym routine requires consistency. There is no other more effective strategy, however there is also no tougher strategy. Maintaining any type of fitness routine day after day can turn into a grueling endeavor. Offsetting this tedious training side effect requires the help of specific goals designed to get the most out of your fitness journey. Learn how to set smart fitness goals that will carry you through every training session and towards achieving your health goals.

## Keys to Goal Setting

Whether you’re a beginner setting new year’s resolutions or an experienced lifter looking to optimize your day to day training, setting fitness goals is a necessary part of maximizing your strength training or cardio routine. Building muscle or optimizing your VO2 max takes time, and creating a series of realistic fitness goals will bring you all the more closer to doing so.

In order to set your own goals right, you must first lay the parameters for these goals. Above all else, they should be measurable, attainable, and contain daily steps. Smaller goals are often more important than larger goals for achieving these last two aims. Having time-bound actions that you can do each day will provide you with consistent feelings of accomplishment that maximize motivation. These smaller goals could be rep and set goals, heart rate goals, or even time frame goals. As long as they are measurable and doable on a small scale, they will work.

Another element to consider with these attainable solutions is how they factor into your larger vision of fitness success. When you have a quiet moment, take the time to check in with yourself and see if these daily steps align with what you truly want all of this physical activity to bring you. If both your short and long term goals are in congruence, then you’re on the right track for maximizing fitness motivation.

## Goals Setting Resources

In order to keep up with your long-term goals, having some external assistance can greatly benefit you. Fitness apps are an effective way to start. Many of these apps have trackers, fitness classes, and community communication, all of which provide support and reinforcement. Sense of community can also be found in a fitness partner or in personal training. A certified personal trainer also has the added benefits of organizing your exercise program, adjusting your short-term goals to your current fitness level, and providing accountability. Either way, enlisting some backup help can certainly add another layer of support to your workout routine.

## Going Forward

Keep your goals dialed in, and they’ll do most of the motivational lifting for you. Find your way towards fitness success in the form of a well constructed plan.
